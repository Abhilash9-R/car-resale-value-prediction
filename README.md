# Car Resale Value Prediction 🚗

This is a data analytics project that predicts the resale value of cars based on features like model year, mileage, kilometers driven, fuel type, and transmission.

## 📁 Files in this project
- `car_resale_data.csv` - Sample dataset
- `main.py` - Python script to train and test the model
- `README.md` - Project explanation

## 🧠 How it works
1. Loads the dataset using pandas
2. Encodes text data (like Petrol/Diesel) into numbers
3. Trains a Linear Regression model to predict resale value
4. Evaluates how well it performs using Mean Squared Error

## ✅ Run it like this
Make sure you have Python and these libraries:
```
pandas
scikit-learn
```

Then run:
```bash
python main.py
```
